        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only going to talk about my tiny experience in
            College.<sup>[1]</sup>
            It's because I'm only a second year student at <abbr title ="University Of The East"><b><i><u>UE</u></i></b></abbr> Manila.<sup>[2]</sup>
            But for me College is the <strong>hardest</strong> thing I’ve experienced in my entire life.<sup>[3]</sup>
            That’s because I really have to <ins>take things <strong>seriously</strong></ins>.<sup>[4]</sup> I have to
            work hard to make sure that I
            will not be left behind.<sup>[5]</sup> Entering college life is <strong>frightening</strong> because It’s a
            new environment.<sup>[6]</sup>
            Also It’s because I'm from the academic strand called <abbr title="Science,Technology,Engineering, and Mathematics"><b><u>STEM</u></b></abbr> 
            and I choose the college program of <abbr title="Information Technology"><b><u>IT</u></b></abbr>.<sup>[7]</sup>
            I'm <em>afraid</em> that maybe I will not learn anything because all I know about <abbr title="Information Technology"><b><u>IT</u></b></abbr> is programming.<sup>[8]</sup>
            I only have a little experience in the field of it and the reason for that is the immersion that
            i take in senior high school.<sup>[9]</sup> Where they teach us how to fix and detach a
            computer.<sup>[10]</sup>
            We also do some HTML but I really have no idea what I am doing.<sup>[11]</sup> Afterall it's my first time
            doing
            that and I don't know anything about it.<sup>[12]</sup> Once it crossed my mind that maybe I chose the wrong
            program and what if I took a college program that related to the <abbr title="Science,Technology,Engineering, and Mathematics"><b><u>STEM</u></b></abbr> 
            strand like engineering.<sup>[13]</sup>
            But after a few months I’ve realized that I chose the right college program because we were guided
            by our professor, especially in the programming course.<sup>[14]</sup> They teach us <ins><strong>step by step</strong></ins> about
            programming.<sup>[15]</sup>
            They make sure that everybody can follow.<sup>[16]</sup> I’ve also met a lot of new friends in
            college.<sup>[17]</sup> Some of
            them are the reason why I understand how to program because they teach me new things and I think
            it enhances my logical thinking.<sup>[18]</sup> However some of them left but I will never forget them
            because
            they <strong>helped me to be better</strong>.<sup>[19]</sup> Currently we’re in the second semester of our second year and I
            hope
            that <ins>I will pass this year</ins>.<sup>[20]</sup>

            My Teenage years were fun and also a new experience for me.<sup>[1]</sup> It’s because it’s the <strong>next stage</strong>
            of my life.<sup>[2]</sup>
            My teenage years started when I was in <em>High School</em>.<sup>[3]</sup> They say that High School is the <strong>best
            school year</strong>
            that will happen to you and I agree with that because In High School you will experience more
            things.<sup>[4]</sup>
            I remember that in High School it was the <strong>first time</strong> that I've joined school competitions.<sup>[5]</sup>
            It’s fun and tiring because we always practice a lot just to make our presentation perfect.<sup>[6]</sup>
            We practice a lot so that we can present and be the best inorder to win.<sup>[7]</sup> But not every time we
            will
            win because there are some that are better than us.<sup>[8]</sup> We joined a lot of competitions throughout
            our
            High School days.<sup>[9]</sup> Every time that we join we just accept whether <ins>we win or
            lose</ins>.<sup>[10]</sup> It’s because we have
            fun while performing and I think that is what really <strong>matters</strong>.<sup>[11]</sup></blockquote>

        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In High School I’ve experienced a lot of
            <strong>failure</strong>.<sup>[12]</sup> Once i’ve tried to study very hard for the upcoming
            exam.<sup>[13]</sup> I’ve passed the exam but for me the score is low and I think that I can still do
            better.<sup>[14]</sup> However
            I’ve become lazy and sometimes I never study for the upcoming exams because I'm an
            <em>“easy go lucky”</em> kind of person.<sup>[15]</sup> I just trust my stock knowledge and the results are sometimes
            I’ve passed
            but there are also times that I’ve <strong>failed</strong>.<sup>[16]</sup> That’s why in senior High School
            I take things seriously.<sup>[17]</sup>
            I always try to do things in the best way I can and one of the rewarding things that happened
            to me is that my group in research is one of the top 5 groups that presented.<sup>[18]</sup> High School is
            a
            fun experience that has ever happened to me and I will always treasure the memory that happened to
            me.<sup>[19]</sup>
            Whether it’s good or bad because for me it’s the <strong>lesson</strong> that made me <ins>who I am
            today</ins>.<sup>[20]</sup>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p><blockquote>Hello I’m Lorenz Aaron M. Orozco and currently my skills are programming in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>R</strong> and 
            <strong>database</strong>.<sup>[1]</sup> As an It student these are the skills that I’ve learned in <b><abbr title="University of The East">UE</abbr></b>.<sup>[2]</sup> However, the level of my skills are 
            only at an amateur level because I’ve only really known the <b>basics</b> on each one of them.<sup>[3]</sup> Python, Java, and 
            Database are the things that I’ve learned in my 1st year at <b><abbr title="University of The East">UE</abbr></b>.<sup>[4]</sup>
            In the first semester we tackle 
            the Python programming language.<sup>[5]</sup> For me It’s <b><u>hard at first</u></b> because I have no knowledge and background in 
            programming.<sup>[6]</sup> However as the <em>time goes by</em> with practice, patience and willingness to learn you will eventually 
            know how to code in this programming language.<sup>[7]</sup> In our second semester we tackle Java and the Ms. Access which 
            is about the Database.<sup>[8]</sup> Both of them are hard because a <ins>new language</ins> means a new way of solving problems.<sup>[9]</sup> But 
            It’s much easier because I have a background in programming.<sup>[10]</sup> I just have to get used to the things that are 
            needed in order to run a code.<sup>[11]</sup> The difference between Python and Java is that Python is much simpler compared 
            to Java because there are no brackets needed in Python unlike Java.<sup>[12]</sup> We also tackle the Ms.Access it’s fun to do
            because it’s much easier at first but it gets hard especially when we have to create a <b><abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI<abbr></b>.<sup>[13]</sup> We created a 
            <b><abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr></b> based on the database system that we created.<sup>[14]</sup>
            </blockquote></p>
        <p><blockquote>In My Second year In <b><abbr title="University of The East">UE</abbr></b> I’ve learned C#,R, and My sql Database.<sup>[15]</sup> 
            The 2 of them are somehow easy because I have some knowledge in programming.<sup>[16]</sup> The C# is somehow like 
            Java and Mysql is like Ms.Access the only thing that is hard is the R language.<sup>[17]</sup> It’s because the R studio is 
            new for us.<sup>[18]</sup> Wherein It is somehow connected to <b>statistics</b>.<sup>[19]</sup> It was hard at first but it was taught to 
            us step by step by our professor.<sup>[20]</sup> Currently we tackle <b><abbr title="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></b> and I hope that I will learn a lot from it.<sup>[21]</sup>

        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p><blockquote>The thing I like to do everyday is to <em>rest</em> and <em>sleep</em>.<sup>[1]</sup> If I've been given the opportunity to do this thing without 
            a doubt I will do it.<sup>[2]</sup> There are also times when I just watch <em>netflix</em> all day.<sup>[3]</sup> I like to binge watch long series.<sup>[4]</sup> Last year's 
            summer I watched <b>Grey's anatomy</b>.<sup>[5]</sup> It was a good series because it focuses on the life of a surgeon.<sup>[6]</sup> Currently it has 18 seasons
            and I’ve already watched seasons 1-17. I also watch some anime and my favorite is watching <b>One Piece</b> because the main character’s 
            are enjoyable to watch.<sup>[7]</sup> Just seeing them together gives me <b>happiness</b>.<sup>[8]</sup> Also I really like it’s story because it focuses
            on the <b>adventure</b> of the protagonist.<sup>[9]</sup> I also like <em>watching movies</em>, especially the Horror, and thriller genres.<sup>[10]</sup> But I only watch
            Horror movies together with my <em>friends</em> and <em>cousins</em>.<sup>[11]</sup> It’s because I don't enjoy watching it alone and it should be watched 
            with someone you know.<sup>[12]</sup> There are a lot of movies released but as of the moment the movie that i enjoyed the most is <b>spiderman: no way 
            home</b> it’s because of the cast.<sup>[13]</sup> I also like to <em>play online games</em> when given a chance and whenever someone invites me.<sup>[14]</sup> 
            These games are <b>Valorant</b>, <b>League of Legends</b>, <b>ML</b>, and <b>COD</b>.<sup>[15]</sup> However I don't usually play all of the time because it really 
            depends on my mood.<sup>[16]</sup> Sometimes I just use <em>social media</em> like <b>facebook</b> and <b>twitter</b>.<sup>[17]</sup> These two are the social media that 
            I used the most because it keeps me <b>updated</b> on what is happening to my friends and the news here in the Philippines.<sup>[18]</sup> 
            Currently these are my hobbies.<sup>[19]</sup> I don't know if it will stay.<sup>[20]</sup> I guess only <b><u>time will tell</u></b>.<sup>[21]</sup>

        <h2>INTEREST</h2>
        <p><blockquote>I'm interested in many things.<sup>[1]</sup> Before I’m interested in becoming a <em>scientist</em>.<sup>[2]</sup> The reason for that is because 
            I want to know and I'm <b>curious</b> about what chemicals they mix to create something.<sup>[3]</sup> It fascinates me that’s why I wanted 
            to be a <em>Scientist</em>.<sup>[4]</sup> But as the time goes by my interest changes.<sup>[5]</sup> It changes to becoming an <em>architect</em>.<sup>[6]</sup> I want to become an 
            <em>architect</em> because they design buildings.<sup>[7]</sup> I want to design buildings but I realize that I'm not that good when it comes to 
            drawing and because of that I’ve changed my Interest in something close to an <em>Architect</em> and that is to become an <em>Engineer</em>.<sup>[8]</sup> 
            In <b>High school</b> I decided that I want to become an <em>Engineer</em>.<sup>[9]</sup> One of the reasons for that is because they say that there’s 
            money when you graduate as an engineer.<sup>[10]</sup> It’s one of the misconceptions that I have when growing up.<sup>[11]</sup> That’s why in <b><abbr title="Senoior High School">SHS</abbr></b> I choose 
            the <b><abbr title="Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics">STEM</abbr></b> strand.<sup>[12]</sup> I want to know how hard the major subjects in the Engineering field.<sup>[13]</sup> Throughout my year in 
            <b><abbr title="Senior High School">SHS</abbr></b> I must 
            admit that It’s hard because the <b>math</b> and <b>science</b> are different in High school and <b><abbr title="Senior High School">SHS</abbr></b>.<sup>[14]</sup> It’s much harder but I’m determined
             to pass and I’ve passed the exams.<sup>[15]</sup> However throughout my year in <b><abbr title="Senior High School">SHS</abbr></b> I have friends in the ICT strand.<sup>[16]</sup> I'm always interested
              in what they’re doing and because of that I choose to be an <b><abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr></b>.<sup>[17]</sup> I’ve also heard many things about <b><abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr></b>.<sup>[18]</sup> They say that there 
              are a lot of opportunities in <b><abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr></b> and I agree with it.<sup>[19]</sup> It's because the technology that we have is always evolving and 
              getting bigger.<sup>[20]</sup> That’s why I think companies need IT graduates to manage their technologies.<sup>[21]</sup> Currently I'm a second year 
              student of <b><abbr title="University of The East">UE</abbr></b> taking the college program <b><abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr></b> and right now I'm interested in learning more things about <b><abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr></b> so that one day 
              I will be prepared for the job that I will choose.<sup>[22]</sup>

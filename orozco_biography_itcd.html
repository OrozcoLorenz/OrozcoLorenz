        <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im <ins>Lorenz Orozco</ins> My <strong>Childhood years</strong> are all about
            being <em>free</em> and <em>fun</em>.<sup>[1]</sup>
            <b>Free</b> in doing everything and having <b>Fun</b> while doing it</u>.<sup>[2]</sup> I <b>remember</b> when I
            was a kid I used to wake up
            every morning just so that I could <ins>play with my friends outside</ins>.<sup>[3]</sup> I remember every game I
            played it’s called
            text, pogs, etc.<sup>[4]</sup> I play non stop but my parents call me every time if it's lunch and if it's
            afternoon so
            that I can sleep.<sup>[5]</sup> They say that sleeping is really important, maybe that’s why I love sleeping
            up to this
            day so much.<sup>[6]</sup> I also remember I used to take vacation at my cousin's place.<sup>[7]</sup>It’s
            every summer and I'm always <em>excited</em> to go there.
            <sup>[8]</sup> I stay and sleep at their house for <u>1 week</u>.<sup>[9]</sup> It’s <strong>fun</strong> and
            <strong>memorable</strong> because we do a lot of
            things like watching movies, wandering around their place, playing with their friends, and
            etc.<sup>[10]</sup> We also went to our
            province before and it’s so <strong>memorable</strong> because we went to the house of my relatives that I didn’t even know
            who they were.<sup>[11]</sup>
            I just knew them when we visited their place.<sup>[12]</sup> One of the things that we do in the province is
            to <u>go to the beach</u>.<sup>[13]</sup> It's <strong>fun</strong> going
            there because I like the sea.<sup>[14]</sup> Where we go in the morning and stay up to
            afternoon.<sup>[15]</sup> We also wander the places in our province.<sup>[16]</sup>
            It's <strong>fun</strong> because it’s an adventure for me.<sup>[17]</sup> I learned all about the place and
            where some of my cousins live because when we took a
            vacation we always stayed at my grandparents's house.<sup>[18]</sup> It’s so much <strong>fun</strong>
            because it's all new for me.<sup>[19]</sup>. However when the vacation ends that is time to say goodbye.<sup>[20]</sup> 
            So that we can move forward and face another challege that will come to our life.<sup>[20]</sup> But I will never forget this memories that
            I make with everyone because this <strong>memories</strong> makes me <ins>who i am<ins> today.<sup>[21]</sup>

        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            My Teenage years were fun and also a new experience for me.<sup>[1]</sup> It’s because it’s the <strong>next stage</strong>
            of my life.<sup>[2]</sup>
            My teenage years started when I was in <em>High School</em>.<sup>[3]</sup> They say that High School is the <strong>best
            school year</strong>
            that will happen to you and I agree with that because In High School you will experience more
            things.<sup>[4]</sup>
            I remember that in High School it was the <strong>first time</strong> that I've joined school competitions.<sup>[5]</sup>
            It’s fun and tiring because we always practice a lot just to make our presentation perfect.<sup>[6]</sup>
            We practice a lot so that we can present and be the best inorder to win.<sup>[7]</sup> But not every time we
            will
            win because there are some that are better than us.<sup>[8]</sup> We joined a lot of competitions throughout
            our
            High School days.<sup>[9]</sup> Every time that we join we just accept whether <ins>we win or
            lose</ins>.<sup>[10]</sup> It’s because we have
            fun while performing and I think that is what really <strong>matters</strong>.<sup>[11]</sup></blockquote>
        </p>


        <p>
        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In High School I’ve experienced a lot of
            <strong>failure</strong>.<sup>[12]</sup> Once i’ve tried to study very hard for the upcoming
            exam.<sup>[13]</sup> I’ve passed the exam but for me the score is low and I think that I can still do
            better.<sup>[14]</sup> However
            I’ve become lazy and sometimes I never study for the upcoming exams because I'm an
            <em>“easy go lucky”</em> kind of person.<sup>[15]</sup> I just trust my stock knowledge and the results are sometimes
            I’ve passed
            but there are also times that I’ve <strong>failed</strong>.<sup>[16]</sup> That’s why in senior High School
            I take things seriously.<sup>[17]</sup>
            I always try to do things in the best way I can and one of the rewarding things that happened
            to me is that my group in research is one of the top 5 groups that presented.<sup>[18]</sup> High School is
            a
            fun experience that has ever happened to me and I will always treasure the memory that happened to
            me.<sup>[19]</sup>
            Whether it’s good or bad because for me it’s the <strong>lesson</strong> that made me <ins>who I am
            today</ins>.<sup>[20]</sup>

        <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only going to talk about my tiny experience in
            College.<sup>[1]</sup>
            It's because I'm only a second year student at <abbr title ="University Of The East"><b><i><u>UE</u></i></b></abbr> Manila.<sup>[2]</sup>
            But for me College is the <strong>hardest</strong> thing I’ve experienced in my entire life.<sup>[3]</sup>
            That’s because I really have to <ins>take things <strong>seriously</strong></ins>.<sup>[4]</sup> I have to
            work hard to make sure that I
            will not be left behind.<sup>[5]</sup> Entering college life is <strong>frightening</strong> because It’s a
            new environment.<sup>[6]</sup>
            Also It’s because I'm from the academic strand called <abbr title="Science,Technology,Engineering, and Mathematics"><b><u>STEM</u></b></abbr> 
            and I choose the college program of <abbr title="Information Technology"><b><u>IT</u></b></abbr>.<sup>[7]</sup>
            I'm <em>afraid</em> that maybe I will not learn anything because all I know about <abbr title="Information Technology"><b><u>IT</u></b></abbr> is programming.<sup>[8]</sup>
            I only have a little experience in the field of it and the reason for that is the immersion that
            i take in senior high school.<sup>[9]</sup> Where they teach us how to fix and detach a
            computer.<sup>[10]</sup>
            We also do some HTML but I really have no idea what I am doing.<sup>[11]</sup> Afterall it's my first time
            doing
            that and I don't know anything about it.<sup>[12]</sup> Once it crossed my mind that maybe I chose the wrong
            program and what if I took a college program that related to the <abbr title="Science,Technology,Engineering, and Mathematics"><b><u>STEM</u></b></abbr> 
            strand like engineering.<sup>[13]</sup>
            But after a few months I’ve realized that I chose the right college program because we were guided
            by our professor, especially in the programming course.<sup>[14]</sup> They teach us <ins><strong>step by step</strong></ins> about
            programming.<sup>[15]</sup>
            They make sure that everybody can follow.<sup>[16]</sup> I’ve also met a lot of new friends in
            college.<sup>[17]</sup> Some of
            them are the reason why I understand how to program because they teach me new things and I think
            it enhances my logical thinking.<sup>[18]</sup> However some of them left but I will never forget them
            because
            they <strong>helped me to be better</strong>.<sup>[19]</sup> Currently we’re in the second semester of our second year and I
            hope
            that <ins>I will pass this year</ins>.<sup>[20]</sup>

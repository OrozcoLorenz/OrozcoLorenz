        <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im <ins>Lorenz Orozco</ins> My <strong>Childhood years</strong> are all about
            being <em>free</em> and <em>fun</em>.<sup>[1]</sup>
            <b>Free</b> in doing everything and having <b>Fun</b> while doing it</u>.<sup>[2]</sup> I <b>remember</b> when I
            was a kid I used to wake up
            every morning just so that I could <ins>play with my friends outside</ins>.<sup>[3]</sup> I remember every game I
            played it’s called
            text, pogs, etc.<sup>[4]</sup> I play non stop but my parents call me every time if it's lunch and if it's
            afternoon so
            that I can sleep.<sup>[5]</sup> They say that sleeping is really important, maybe that’s why I love sleeping
            up to this
            day so much.<sup>[6]</sup> I also remember I used to take vacation at my cousin's place.<sup>[7]</sup>It’s
            every summer and I'm always <em>excited</em> to go there.
            <sup>[8]</sup> I stay and sleep at their house for <u>1 week</u>.<sup>[9]</sup> It’s <strong>fun</strong> and
            <strong>memorable</strong> because we do a lot of
            things like watching movies, wandering around their place, playing with their friends, and
            etc.<sup>[10]</sup> We also went to our
            province before and it’s so <strong>memorable</strong> because we went to the house of my relatives that I didn’t even know
            who they were.<sup>[11]</sup>
            I just knew them when we visited their place.<sup>[12]</sup> One of the things that we do in the province is
            to <u>go to the beach</u>.<sup>[13]</sup> It's <strong>fun</strong> going
            there because I like the sea.<sup>[14]</sup> Where we go in the morning and stay up to
            afternoon.<sup>[15]</sup> We also wander the places in our province.<sup>[16]</sup>
            It's <strong>fun</strong> because it’s an adventure for me.<sup>[17]</sup> I learned all about the place and
            where some of my cousins live because when we took a
            vacation we always stayed at my grandparents's house.<sup>[18]</sup> It’s so much <strong>fun</strong>
            because it's all new for me.<sup>[19]</sup>. However when the vacation ends that is time to say goodbye.<sup>[20]</sup> 
            So that we can move forward and face another challege that will come to our life.<sup>[20]</sup> But I will never forget this memories that
            I make with everyone because this <strong>memories</strong> makes me <ins>who I am<ins> today.<sup>[21]</sup>
